## pIRCc `(Updated 2009.11.14)` ##

---

The basis for an IRC Client written in Pascal.  Developed using the Lazarus IDE.  Currently this provides core functionality needed to write an IRC client but, it isn't exactly production.  I hope someone finds this code useful.  I will contribute more in the future but this is not one of my primary projects.  Feel free to contact me with questions or code.
